According to the file feature_info.txt in the original UCI HAR Dataset, the definitions of variables in the **processed dataset** are as follows. 

- **Subject_Id**  
    Number 1 to number 30 mean 30 subjects who participate in the experiment.

- **Activity**    
    Each subject performes six activities when wearing a smartphone.
        Walking
        Walking upstairs
        Walking downstairs
        Sitting
        Standing
        Laying

- Variables contain **mean**     
    Mean value.

- Variables contain **std**    
    Standard deviation.

- Variables contain **X, Y or Z**     
    It is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
    
- Variables contain **Gyro or ACC**        
    The smartphone embeds two sensor signals for recording the results of activities, accelerometer and gyroscope respectively.

- Variables contain **Time_Acc_XYZ and Time_Gyro_XYZ**         
    These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.

- Variables contain **Time_BodyAcc_XYZ and Time_GravityAcc_XYZ**       
    The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

- **Time_BodyAccJerk_XYZ and Time_BodyGyroJerk_XYZ**            
    The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.

- **Time_BodyAccMag, Time_GravityAccMag, Time_BodyAccJerkMag, Time_BodyGyroMag and Time_BodyGyroJerkMag**      
    The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

- **Frequency_BodyAcc-XYZ, Frequency_BodyAccJerk-XYZ, Frequency_BodyGyro-XYZ, Frequency_BodyAccJerkMag, Frequency_BodyGyroMag and Frequency_BodyGyroJerkMag**         
    A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing these variables.
